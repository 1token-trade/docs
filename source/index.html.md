# 获取历史行情

## 教程

<b>请求地址</b>：<code>https://hist-quote.1tokentrade.cn</code>

<aside class="notice">
可以先查看<a href='https://1token-trade.github.io/docs/guide/#word-explanation' target="_blank">名词解释</a>和<a href='https://1token-trade.github.io/docs/guide/#data-structure'>数据结构</a>两个小节了解字段含义。
</aside>

<b>请求方式</b>

* 请求历史数据需要提供OT-Key，OT-Key申请方式如下：
  * 注册成为1Token用户；  
  * 在<a href='https://1token.trade/account/apis' target="_blank">用户中心</a>申请OT-Key；
* 请求历史数据时携带名称为ot-key的请求头，例如申请的API-Key为aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd，则请求时需要带上ot-key: aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd，否则会报错；
* 系统会根据key及使用次数进行计费，请参考<a href='https://1token.trade/dataservice'>具体的计费标准</a>；
* 返回数据时在HTTP Header中会携带当次请求扣减次数及剩余次数：
* 使用Demo <a href='https://github.com/1token-trade/onetoken/blob/master/demo-python-sync/get_historical_quote.py' target="_blank">get_historical_quote.py</a> 下载数据

参数 | 描述
--------- | ------- 
ot-quota-consumption | 当次请求扣减次数
ot-quota-remaining | 剩余次数剩余次数



<b>数据获取流程</b>

* 通用规则
  * 交易所信息可以参考：<a href='https://1token-trade.github.io/docs/guide/#exchange-overview'>支持的交易所</a>；
  * 交易对命名规则可以参考：<a href='https://1token-trade.github.io/docs/guide/#naming-rules'>变量命名规则</a>；
* Tick(盘口+最新成交)数据
  * 从api 获取某一天的所有交易对的列表，比如<a href='https://hist-quote.1tokentrade.cn/ticks/contracts?date=2020-04-12'>2020年4月12日的所有交易对列表</a>；
  * 选好想要下载的交易对，比如okex/btc.usdt；
  * 选择需要完整亦或是简单快照数据，具体区别请参考历史tick小节；
  * 使用 <code>/ticks</code> 接口下载特定日期指定交易对的数据；
* Trade(逐笔成交)数据  
  * 从api 获取某一天的所有交易对的列表，比如<a href='https://hist-quote.1tokentrade.cn/trades/contracts?date=2020-04-12'>2020年4月12日的所有交易对列表</a>；
  * 选好想要下载的交易对，比如okex/btc.usdt；
  * 使用 <code>/trades</code> 接口下载特定日期指定交易对的数据；
* Candle(K线)数据  
  * 选好想要下载的交易对，比如okex/btc.usdt以及okef/btc.usd.q；
  * 可通过<code>/candles/since</code> 接口获得交易对数据的起始时间戳；
  * 可通过<code>/candles</code> 接口获得数据，可以指定时间区间、指定交易对以及周期；
  * 一次最多返回15000根K线, 超过这个数量会返回 `400 {"code": "time-range-too-large", "message": "max candle size 15000"}`
  

## 限制

<aside class="warning">接口限制为1秒10个请求，超过这个数量会返回HTTP 429错误。</aside>

## 时间戳

历史数据内包含相关的交易所时间，时间格式采用UNIX时间戳以及ISO Format格式，示例如下：

* 1595395700
* 2020-07-22T05:28:20.000000Z
* 2020-07-22T05:28:20.000000+00:00
* 2020-07-22T13:28:20.000000+08:00

以上四个数值均代表了北京时间2020年7月22日下午13点28分20秒。

## 获取支持的合约列表

<code>GET /[ticks|trades]/contracts?date={date} </code>


* 不需要ot-key；
* 请求中params含义如下：<code>date</code> 是指需要获取数据的日期，格式为<code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>；
* 返回值为当前有数据的交易对列表

<code>
[
  "bigone/1st.btc",
  "bittrex/1st.btc",
  "hitbtc/1st.btc",
  ...
]
</code>

* 现货（币币）交易代码由3部分组成，`{exchange}/{underlying}.{quote_currency}`
* 期货交易代码由4部分组成，`{exchange}/{underlying}.{quote_currency}.{delivery}`，bitmex交易所没有delivery的合约是该交易所指定交易对的参考指数。
